# NKA-Wallet-Generator

NKA-Wallet-Generator is a modified version of the WalletGenerator.net repository (https://github.com/MichaelMure/WalletGenerator.net)

NKA-Wallet-Generator is focused on Incakoin (NKA) only and can be downloaded on https://github.com/WorldBot/NKA-Wallet-Generator/archive/master.zip to run a local copy for more security.


Download this from Github and open the index.html file directly from your computer

I recommended using Google Chrome

If you want to add your own design, contact Yannic on IRC freenode #incakoin or fork your own copy and pull request
Thanks
